As of Friday, 4/6

TOP PRIORITY: Fix spatial deconvolution bugs and do testing
  X - Random high and low values in spatial source simulation, may affect response reading as well
  X - (find a way to prevent algorithm from restricted matches that are later overridden by pseudo-matches) Ensure algorithm keeps track of each source separately
  X - Make it work for non-square surveys
  X - Skip/alter fineness for processing if not enough survey data
  X - Implement record keeping and data exporting
    X - Validate recording of source meshes
  - Benchmarking for numbers of isotopes, fineness, iterations

- Benchmark energy deconvolution for combinations of isotopes
- Implement intensity result normalization for energy deconvolution
- Update data_read.cc to pick up data from database on robot (or on remote pc?)
- Write additional class to export result data?
X (remember to update this)- Doxygen?
